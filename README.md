Bayesian Network (BN) has been used in the data management and analytics field for its interpretability and causality, and Attribution is the important usage of Bayesian Network.
However, hundreds of nodes in the network and millions of samples used on the attribution process need many computers work together on distributed pattern.
Thus we developed a distributed framework, named DistriBayes, for big scale Bayesian Network's attribution. Leveraging the distributed cluster, DistriBayes can finish the attribution on Bayesian Network for hundreds of nodes with millions of samples in hours. With multiple iterations and the filtering mechanism, we make efficient attribution and obtain effective results in the real case of the financial field. This paper introduces the detail of DistriBayes.
